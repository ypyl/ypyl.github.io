### 1. Modal Verbs: Softening Certainty

Use modal verbs like 'would,' 'could,' 'may,' and 'might' to reduce certainty and appear more cooperative.

- "This is a problem" becomes "This could be a challenge."
- "This idea will not work" transforms into "This idea might not work."
- "You should complete the task" softens to "You could consider completing the task."

### 2. Alternatives to Can't and Won't: Navigating Disagreements

Avoid phrases like 'can't' and 'won't' in negotiations. Opt for alternatives such as 'be unable' or 'not in a position to' for a more diplomatic tone.

- "We won't accept a deadline of two weeks" changes to "We are not in a position to accept a deadline of two weeks."
- "I can't support your proposal" becomes "I am unable to fully support your proposal."

- "You should complete the report" transforms into "The report should be completed."

### 3b. Passive Phrases: Creating Distance

Use passive phrases such as 'it was said,' 'it was thought,' 'it was understood,' and 'it is assumed' to avoid direct blame.

- "They thought the project would be completed by now" becomes "It was thought that the project would be completed by now."
- "You understood the requirements" transforms into "It was understood that the requirements were clear."
