## Indirect Questions

Indirect questions serve as a polite and diplomatic way to seek information or make requests. Using introductory phrases is crucial for constructing these questions. Consider the following examples:

1. **Could you tell me what you need to get this task done?**
   - *Introductory phrase + question word + positive sentence*
   - This example demonstrates how to politely ask a colleague about the requirements for completing a task.

2. **Do you happen to know where the meeting room is?**
   - *Introductory phrase + positive sentence*
   - By using an introductory phrase, this question becomes more polite and less direct, suitable for asking directions.

3. **I wonder if we could move the release date.**
   - *Introductory phrase + if/whether + positive sentence*
   - In this case, an indirect question is employed to suggest a possible change in plans diplomatically.

### Introductory phrases:

- Do you know …
- I wonder / was wondering ….
- Can / Could you tell me …
- Do you happen to know ...
- Do you have any idea ...
- Would you mind telling me…
- May I ask…
- I'd like to know …

## Negative Questions

Negative questions provide a diplomatic way to express concerns or opinions without sounding too direct. Consider the following examples:

1. **Wouldn’t we be taking a huge risk?**
   - *Negative auxiliary + subject + positive sentence*
   - This example transforms a statement about a risk into a diplomatic question, inviting others to participate in the decision-making process.

2. **Wouldn’t it be better to discuss this proposal with other team members?**
   - *Negative auxiliary + subject + positive sentence*
   - By framing the suggestion as a negative question, the speaker encourages agreement and maintains a more indirect tone.

3. **They can’t both be right, can they?**
   - *Negative auxiliary + positive sentence*
   - This question tag allows room for discussion and persuasiveness, particularly useful in negotiation scenarios.

Negative questions can be formed using negative auxiliaries like 'shouldn’t,' 'wouldn’t,' 'don’t,' or 'won’t,' creating a more diplomatic tone and leaving room for discussion.

## Question Tags

Question tags contribute to politeness and interaction in both statements and suggestions. Here are examples:

1. **The reports are ready, aren't they?**
   - *Positive verb + negative tag*
   - By adding a question tag, this statement becomes an invitation for agreement, fostering interaction.

2. **We are meeting next week, aren't we?**
   - *Positive verb + negative tag*
   - Question tags, as demonstrated here, can maintain engagement and politeness in various situations.

3. **Let's start the meeting, shall we?**
   - *Positive verb + positive tag*
   - Using a tag softens the suggestion, making it more polite and encouraging participation.

### EXCEPTIONS

1. After ‘I am’ the tag is ‘aren't’, e.g.

- I am late, aren't I?
- BUT: I am not late, am I?

2. After ‘let’s’ the tag is ‘shall’, e.g.

- Let's go to the beach, shall we?
