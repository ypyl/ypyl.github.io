# Sliding Window

![sliding-window](./images/52s4F62R2c.png)

## Usage

This algorithmic technique is used when we need to handle the input data in a specific window size.

## Data Structures Involved

Array, String, HashTable

## Sample Problems

### [Longest Substring with 'K' Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)

The solution to this problem is to use the sliding window technique. The idea is to maintain a window of size k and slide it over the string. At each step, we check if the current window contains k distinct characters. If it does, we update the maximum length of the substring. If it doesnâ€™t, we slide the window to the right until we find a window that contains k distinct characters again. We repeat this process until we reach the end of the string

### [Fruits into Baskets](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/)

It is a sliding window problem where we are given an input array representing different types of fruits and two baskets. We want to collect some fruits from a subarray. However, each basket can only hold one type of fruit. In other words, we can collect at most 2 types of fruits. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets. Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.

# Islands (Matrix Traversal)

# Two Pointers

![two-pointers](./images/OKJsB0cjio.png)

## Usage

This technique uses two pointers to iterate input data. Generally, both pointers move in the opposite direction at a constant interval.

## Data Structures Involved

Array, String, LinkedList

## Sample Problems

# Fast & Slow Pointers

![fast-and-slow-pointers](./images/fUvRwuxhNX.png)

## Usage

Also known as Hare & Tortoise algorithm. This technique uses two pointers that traverse the input data at different speeds.

## Data Structures Involved

Array, String, LinkedList

## Sample Problems

- [Middle of the LinkedList](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)
- [Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)
- [Cycle in a Circular Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/circular-array-loop/)

# Merge Intervals

![merge-intervals](./images/x2PtTNmFVR.png)

## Usage

This technique is used to deal with overlapping intervals.

## Data Structures Involved

Array, Heap

## Sample Problems

- [Conflicting Appointments](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)
- [Minimum Meeting Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-iii/)

# Cyclic Sort

![cyclic-sort](./images/6HAc3A1uk.webp)

## Usage

Use this technique to solve array problems where the input data lies within a fixed range.

## Data Structures Involved

# In-place Reversal of a LinkedList

![in-place-reversal](./images/reverse-linked-list.gif)

## Usage

This technique describes an efficient way to reverse the links between a set of nodes of a LinkedList. Often, the constraint is that we need to do this in-place, i.e., using the existing node objects and without using extra memory.

## Data Structures Involved

LinkedList

## Sample Problems

- [Reverse every K-element Sub-list](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/)
- [Rotate a LinkedList](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/)

# Breadth-First Search

## Usage

In many problems, we are given a set of elements that can be divided into two parts. We are interested in knowing the smallest element in one part and the biggest element in the other part. As the name suggests, this technique uses a Min-Heap to find the smallest element and a Max-Heap to find the biggest element.
