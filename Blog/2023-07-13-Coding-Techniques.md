# Sliding Window

![sliding-window](./images/52s4F62R2c.png)

## Description

The Sliding Window coding technique is a strategy used in computer programming to efficiently process arrays, strings, or other sequence-based data structures. It involves maintaining a window that slides through the input data, manipulating and updating elements as it moves along. By adjusting the window's size or position based on the problem's requirements, the technique allows for the efficient computation or discovery of subarrays, substrings, or subsequences that satisfy specific conditions. This approach significantly reduces time complexity, often from O(n^2) to O(n) or even O(1), making it ideal for solving problems with large input sizes. By reusing information from the previous window, unnecessary recomputation is avoided, resulting in improved algorithmic performance. Overall, the Sliding Window technique offers an effective solution for efficiently processing sequence-based data, optimizing computations, and solving algorithmic problems.

## Data Structures Involved

Array, String, HashTable

## Sample Problems

### [Longest Substring with 'K' Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)

The solution to this problem is to use the sliding window technique. The idea is to maintain a window of size k and slide it over the string. At each step, we check if the current window contains k distinct characters. If it does, we update the maximum length of the substring. If it doesnâ€™t, we slide the window to the right until we find a window that contains k distinct characters again. We repeat this process until we reach the end of the string

### [Fruits into Baskets](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/)

It is a sliding window problem where we are given an input array representing different types of fruits and two baskets. We want to collect some fruits from a subarray. However, each basket can only hold one type of fruit. In other words, we can collect at most 2 types of fruits. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets. Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.

## Description

The Depth First Search (DFS) technique is a coding strategy used to traverse or search graph-like structures in a depthward manner. It starts from a specified source vertex and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. The DFS technique utilizes a stack or recursion to keep track of the vertices to visit. It visits a vertex, marks it as visited, and then recursively explores its adjacent unvisited vertices. This process continues until all reachable vertices have been visited or a specific condition is met. DFS is commonly employed to solve problems like finding connected components, detecting cycles, or exploring all possible paths in a graph or tree. Its depthward nature makes it particularly useful for exploring and analyzing graph structures efficiently.
