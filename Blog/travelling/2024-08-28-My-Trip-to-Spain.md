# My Trip to Spain

Recently, I had the pleasure of visiting Spain, and I wanted to share some highlights and observations from the trip.

## Accommodation

I stayed at an apartment which you can check out [here](http://www.justaapartamento.com/). While the location was convenient, I noticed a couple of downsides:
- **Lack of a Work Table**: Unfortunately, the apartment didn’t have a table suitable for working with a laptop, which was a bit inconvenient.
- **Fan Issues**: One of the bedrooms had a fan that didn’t work, making it a bit uncomfortable, especially during the warm nights.

## Pool Experience

The apartment complex had a pool, but it was often crowded. Many local people seemed to use it as a social gathering spot, so it wasn’t always the most relaxing place for a swim.

## Beach and Swimming

The nearby beach was fantastic, with great sandy areas that are ideal for families with small children. However, during my stay, the waves were quite big. Thankfully, there's a safer spot to swim during such conditions, which you can find [here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/38.032165/-0.651117).

## Local Amenities

### Supermarket

The closest supermarket was conveniently located, which made it easy to pick up daily essentials. You can find it [here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/7126908485#map=19/38.025324/-0.654105&layers=N). They even had normal milk available, which was great!

### Local Market

On Wednesday morning (7:00 - 12:00), there is a local market where you can buy fresh fruits, chicken, honey, and other local goods at reasonable prices. The market is located [here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?lat=38.024076&lon=-0.654880#map=19/38.024075/-0.654880&layers=N).

## Weather

The weather during my stay was quite windy, which was a bit of a challenge. However, it changed to a calm, no-wind condition on the 17th of August, making the latter part of the trip more enjoyable.

## Entertainment

One of the highlights of the trip was a fantastic show designed for kids. It’s a high-octane car show that you can learn more about [here](https://costablancakids.com/high-octane-car-show-for-kids-in-costa-blanca/). It was a great experience for the entire family!

## Budget

The total cost of the trip (4 weeks) was around 5000 EUR, broken down as follows:
- **Apartments**: 2500 EUR
- **Road expenses**: 1000 EUR
- **Interim apartments**: 500 EUR
- **Shopping, restaurants, and shows**: 1000 EUR (This included shopping, dining at restaurants twice, and attending two shows.)

Overall, it was a memorable trip with a mix of relaxation, local culture, and fun experiences.
