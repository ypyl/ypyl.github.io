**Machine Learning 101: What is it and how does it work?**

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that uses data to learn patterns and make predictions. It is one of the most exciting and rapidly evolving fields in computer science, with applications ranging from health care to entertainment.

But how does machine learning actually work? In this blog post, we will explain the basic steps involved in creating and using a machine learning model.

**Step 1: Training**

The first step is to collect and prepare some data that contains past observations of the problem we want to solve. For example, if we want to predict the number of ice cream sales based on the weather, we need some historical data that shows the weather conditions and the ice cream sales for each day.

The data consists of two parts: the features and the label. The features are the attributes or measurements of the thing we are observing, such as the temperature, rainfall, and windspeed. The label is the value we want to predict, such as the number of ice creams sold.

We then apply an algorithm to the data that tries to find a relationship between the features and the label, and generalize that relationship as a mathematical function. The function takes the features as input and calculates the label as output. The algorithm tries to find the best function that fits the data and minimizes the error between the predicted and the actual labels.

The result of the training process is a machine learning model, which is a software program that encapsulates the function.

**Step 2: Inferencing**

The second step is to use the trained model to make predictions on new data. For example, if we have a new day with a certain weather condition, we can input the features of that day into the model and get an output of the predicted ice cream sales.

The output of the model is a prediction that was calculated by the function, not an observed value. Therefore, it may not be exactly accurate, and it may vary depending on the quality and quantity of the data and the algorithm used to train the model.


## Supervised machine learning

Supervised machine learning is when you have data that includes both the features (the input variables) and the labels (the output values)¹[1]. For example, you might have data about the size, shape, and color of different fruits, and their corresponding names. Supervised machine learning algorithms can learn the relationship between the features and the labels, and then use that to predict the label for new data²[2]. For example, if you give the algorithm a picture of a fruit, it can tell you what kind of fruit it is.

There are two main subtypes of supervised machine learning: regression and classification. Regression is when the label is a numeric value, such as the price of a house or the fuel efficiency of a car³[3]. Classification is when the label is a category, such as the type of animal or the genre of a movie. Classification can be further divided into binary classification (when there are only two possible categories) and multiclass classification (when there are more than two possible categories).

## Unsupervised machine learning

Unsupervised machine learning is when you have data that only includes the features, but not the labels⁴[4]. For example, you might have data about the browsing behavior of different website visitors, but not their personal information or preferences. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms can discover patterns and structures in the data, without any prior knowledge or guidance. For example, they can group similar data points together based on their features, or find outliers that deviate from the norm.

The most common form of unsupervised machine learning is clustering⁵[5]. Clustering is when you partition the data into discrete groups, or clusters, based on their similarity⁶[6]. For example, you can cluster customers based on their demographics and purchasing behavior, or cluster flowers based on their size and shape⁷[7]. Clustering can help you understand the diversity and distribution of your data, and identify potential segments or categories.

# Regression

It is a type of supervised machine learning that can be used to predict numeric values based on features and labels¹[1]. Regression models are useful for many scenarios, such as forecasting sales, estimating house prices, or predicting customer satisfaction.

To train a regression model, we need to follow four steps:²[2]

- Split the data into a training set and a validation set.
- Use an algorithm to fit the training data to a function that describes the relationship between the features and the label³[3].
- Use the validation data to test the model by predicting labels for the features and comparing them to the actual labels⁴[4].
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error, and coefficient of determination.

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values¹[1]. It amplifies larger errors.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of the MSE²[2]¹[1]. It measures the error in the same units as the label.
- **Coefficient of determination (R2)**: A value between 0 and 1 that indicates the proportion of variance in the validation results that can be explained by the model³[3]. The closer to 1, the better the model fits the data⁴[4].

Iterative training is a process of repeatedly training and evaluating a supervised machine learning model until an acceptable level of predictive accuracy is achieved¹[1]. It involves varying the following aspects of the model:

- **Feature selection and preparation**: Choosing which features to include in the model, and applying calculations to them to help ensure a better fit²[2].
- **Algorithm selection**: Using different regression algorithms, such as linear regression or others³[3].
- **Algorithm parameters**: Adjusting numeric settings to control algorithm behavior, also called hyperparameters⁴[4].

The model that results in the best evaluation metric for the specific scenario is selected⁵[5].

# binary classification

Have you ever wondered how machines can learn to classify things into categories, such as spam or not spam, cat or dog, positive or negative? In this blog, I will introduce you to the basics of **binary classification**, a type of supervised machine learning technique that can do just that.

**What is binary classification?**¹[1]

Binary classification is a way of training a machine learning model to predict one of two possible labels for a single class²[2]. For example, you can use binary classification to train a model that predicts whether an email is spam (1) or not spam (0), based on the words and other features in the email.

**How does binary classification work?**¹[1]

To train a binary classification model, you need some data with features (x) and labels (y). The features are the input variables that describe the data, such as the words in an email. The labels are the output variables that indicate the class, such as spam or not spam. The model learns a function that maps the features to the labels, and calculates the probability of the label being true (1) for a given feature value³[3].

One of the common algorithms for binary classification is **logistic regression**, which produces a sigmoid (S-shaped) function that describes the probability distribution between 0 and 1⁴[4]. The function has a threshold value, usually 0.5, that determines the predicted label. If the probability is above the threshold, the model predicts true (1); if it is below the threshold, the model predicts false (0)⁵[5].

**How do you evaluate a binary classification model?**⁶[6]

To evaluate how well a binary classification model performs, you need some validation data that was not used for training. You can then compare the predicted labels (ŷ) to the actual labels (y) for the validation data, and calculate some metrics, such as:⁷[7]

- **Accuracy**: the proportion of predictions that the model got right⁸[8].
- **Recall**: the proportion of positive cases that the model identified correctly⁹[9].
- **Precision**: the proportion of predicted positive cases where the true label is actually positive[^10^][10].
- **F1-score**: an overall metric that combines recall and precision¹¹[11].
- **Area Under the Curve (AUC)**: a metric that measures the performance of the model across all possible threshold values, by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR) for each threshold. A perfect model would have an AUC of 1.0, while a random model would have an AUC of 0.5.

## multiclass classification

Hi everyone, today I want to share with you some basics of **multiclass classification**, a machine learning technique that can predict multiple possible outcomes for a given observation²[2].

**What is multiclass classification?**¹[1]

Multiclass classification is used when we have a dataset with more than two possible classes or categories. For example, suppose we have some data about penguins, and we want to predict their species based on their flipper length. There are three possible species: Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap. A multiclass classifier can learn from the data and assign a probability score for each species, and then predict the most likely one for a new observation.

**How does multiclass classification work?**¹[1]

There are two main types of algorithms for multiclass classification: **One-vs-Rest (OvR)** and **Multinomial**.

- OvR algorithms train a binary classifier for each class, and compare it to the rest of the classes³[3]. For example, one classifier would learn to distinguish Adelie from Gentoo and Chinstrap, another would learn to distinguish Gentoo from Adelie and Chinstrap, and so on. Each classifier produces a probability value between 0 and 1, and the class with the highest value is the predicted one.
- Multinomial algorithms train a single classifier that produces a vector of probability values for all classes⁴[4]. For example, one classifier would learn to output something like [0.2, 0.3, 0.5] for a given observation, where each number represents the probability of being Adelie, Gentoo, or Chinstrap respectively. The class with the highest value is the predicted one.

**How do we evaluate multiclass classification?**⁵[5]

We can evaluate a multiclass classifier by using metrics such as **accuracy**, **recall**, **precision**, and **F1-score**. These metrics measure how well the classifier performs on the validation or test data, and can be calculated for each individual class or for the overall model. For example, accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions, recall is the proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly predicted, precision is the proportion of predicted positive cases that are actually positive, and F1-score is the harmonic mean of recall and precision.

**Why is multiclass classification useful?**¹[1]

Multiclass classification is useful for many real-world problems that involve multiple possible outcomes. For example, we can use multiclass classification to:

- Recognize handwritten digits from 0 to 9
- Classify news articles into different categories
- Identify the breed of a dog from a picture
- Diagnose a disease based on symptoms
- And much more!

## clustering

Have you ever wondered how machines can learn from data without being explicitly told what to do? One way to achieve this is through **clustering**, a form of **unsupervised machine learning**. In this blog post, I will explain what clustering is, how it works, and why it is useful.

**What is clustering?**

Clustering is a technique that groups similar data points together based on their features, or values¹[1]. For example, if you have a dataset of flowers with two features: number of leaves and number of petals, you can use clustering to find out which flowers are more alike based on these features²[2]. The result of clustering is a set of clusters, each containing data points that are closer to each other than to data points in other clusters.

**How does clustering work?**

There are many algorithms that can perform clustering, but one of the most common ones is **K-Means clustering**³[3]. This algorithm works as follows:

- You decide how many clusters you want to create - let's call this number k⁴[4].
- You randomly choose k points in the data space as the initial centers of the clusters - these are called centroids.
- You assign each data point to the cluster whose centroid is nearest to it⁵[5].
- You update the centroids by moving them to the average location of the data points in their cluster.
- You repeat the assignment and update steps until the clusters stop changing or a maximum number of iterations is reached⁶[6].

**Why is clustering useful?**

Clustering can help you discover hidden patterns and structures in your data, as well as reduce the complexity and dimensionality of your data. Some of the applications of clustering are:

- **Customer segmentation**: You can use clustering to group your customers based on their preferences, behavior, or demographics, and then tailor your marketing strategies accordingly.
- **Image compression**: You can use clustering to reduce the number of colors in an image by assigning each pixel to a cluster that represents a color, and then replacing each pixel with the color of its cluster.
- **Anomaly detection**: You can use clustering to identify outliers or abnormal data points that do not belong to any cluster, and then investigate them for potential errors or fraud.
