[Aha!](http://www.aha.io/)

Aha! is the world's #1 product roadmap and marketing planning software. We help more than 5,000 innovative companies build and launch products customers love. More than 250,000 users worldwide trust Aha! to set brilliant strategy, capture customer ideas, create visual roadmaps, and manage breakthrough marketing programs.

The company was founded in 2013 by Silicon Valley veterans and product and marketing experts Brian de Haaff and Dr. Chris Waters. Aha! is the 13th fastest-growing private software company in the U.S. on the Inc. 5000 list. The company is self-funded and profitable with an entirely remote team.

Our goal at Aha! is to help people roadmap and launch products customers love and work with conviction. We want you to discover (or re-discover) your mojo — that sense of potency, confidence, and swagger that you have when you say to yourself, "I've got this." So join us on this epic adventure.

In April 2017, we published a provocative book that shares our philosophy and the story of our exceptional growth — Lovability. The book explains that customer love is within reach for anyone who designs, builds, and delivers a product. Anyone. These concepts are not complicated, with one caveat. You have to be willing to dismiss preconceived notions about what can be loved. And that is what makes Aha! and the book unique. It takes a feeling that we all know — love — and applies it to the complex task of building products and companies. And it plainly shows you how to do it, while explaining why everything you think you know about hype-inspired innovation is likely wrong.

After all, life is short. Why spend it doing anything less than meaningful work with people you care about? Let us help you find even greater inspiration and a few new approaches to be your best.

[YNAB (YouNeedABudget)](http://www.youneedabudget.com)

We provide award-winning software to implement our method. YNAB operates with a growing team remotely located all over the world. We are passionate about helping people change their lives through delivering high-quality education and software. As a team, we operate under the following Cultural Manifesto: "We think it’s important to be helpful and teach one another. You know, lend a helping hand, and look to ease a friend’s burden. When you’re friendly, I guess it means that you take an interest in others, and tend to listen more than you talk. If you (gasp!) change your mind, we think that’s cool, because…well, there’s nothing wrong with changing your mind. When speaking of others be kind. Is what you’re about to say true, kind, and necessary? We love confidently humble people who are proud of their craft, and stay humble so they don’t stop learning. You know what makes life great? You assume good intentions, and give others the benefit of the doubt. Even then, you may still disagree—a healthy problem to have between two people that listen, and then listen more. With all of that said, the disciplined and relentless pursuit of important (sometimes scary) things is awesome. And my heavens, if you have a sense of humo(u)r, we want you around (because you’re hilarious)."​ We give birthday and Christmas gifts, have fantastic annual meet ups, give generous vacation that isn't tracked (if it's not at least four weeks, we'll scold you), provide unmatched scheduling flexibility (you don't "clock in"​--that's absurd), and basically have created a place where you: 1) Make a difference in people's lives 2) Express yourself through your best work and 3) Don't forget to have a life outside of work. Feel free to reach out if this speaks to you!

[PeopleG2](http://www.peopleg2.com)

PeopleG2 is a 10+ year old Human Capital Risk Management firm founded on the core belief that all suppliers of services should “truly make a difference” – even if they’re operating in an industry that most people view as highly commoditized. This is WHY we exist. Our value-add approach to standard and custom pre-employment screening programs is based on keeping the element of "personal staff attention and critical thinking"​ noticeably in the mix when servicing all customer organizations. Given recent multi-million dollar FTC fines against some of our competitors for ... "not using reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of information sold to customers"​ ... our adherence to a delivery model involving personal staff attention and critical thinking is HOW we make a difference as a supplier of HR-related decision-support services. The accuracy and completeness of an individual's information contained on commercial and public/government agency databases should never be taken for granted, and employers making hiring or promotion decisions should feel assured that these decisions are not unduly omitting -- or erroneously considering -- key information. This is WHAT we do -- deliver the highest quality Human Capital Due Diligence services to support the highest quality employment and workforce decisions. The recent attention our company has received in Forbes and HR Executive Online highlights that we're not only approaching this market differently, but also delivering higher-end, more strategic services that no other industry provider offers.

Harish Venkatesan, one of our co-founders, came up with the idea for the company in 2012 while reading Creative Workshop, a book of design exercises. It became clear that a continuous cycle of feedback and iteration is essential for anyone aspiring to improve their design skills. Over the past five years, we’ve brought that idea to life by crafting our vision of an ideal online learning platform. Every Designlab student is paired with an expert designer as their mentor, completes several hands-on projects, and receives ongoing design feedback and peer support from our student community. Our mission is to empower creators. With today’s design tools, creators can build products and services with the potential to enrich the lives of billions of people worldwide. New products are launched every day, so good design is crucial to staying relevant in a competitive market. Today, more than ever before, you can cheaply experiment and reinvent your skills until you find what you truly love. After all, you spend 60% of your waking hours at work, so it’s only right that you enjoy it. In this environment, we believe these traits are more important than ever: Creativity. Lifelong learning. Passion for your work. These have no place: Crippling student debt. Unfulfilling jobs. Unsatisfying careers that we choose by default. We’re combining the power of the internet with the magic of 1-on-1 mentoring to create an invaluable educational experience that is affordable and accessible worldwide. Our goal is to guide you to find the creative work you love, and to help you become a master of your craft. Join us!

We are now officially in a multi-device world. 2 in 3 e-commerce shoppers start their interaction on one device, likely their smartphone, and continue that journey on another. As marketers competing for consumers’ attention in an increasingly noisy setting, it is imperative that we make those journeys seamless experiences, regardless of what device your customers are on. That’s the mission we are obsessed with at Swym – creating delightfully seamless shopping journeys for your customers. The typical shopping journey today spans multiple sessions/channels/devices, with a majority of e-commerce purchases resulting from a multi-session shopping experience. E-commerce sites are not adequately equipped to facilitate this new usage pattern, leaving their customers on their own to navigate between devices. Swym powers a cross-channel shopping platform for retailers, built to intuitively address the needs of today’s consumer, and can be easily integrated into an existing e-commerce site. Retailers can leverage the Swym platform to maximize the value of each customer interaction by enabling seamless multi-screen shopping experiences for shoppers.
