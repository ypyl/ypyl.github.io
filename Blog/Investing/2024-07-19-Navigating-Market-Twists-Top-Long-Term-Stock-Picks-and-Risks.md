**Current Events:**
- **Google**: Alphabet, Google's parent company, is in advanced talks to acquire cybersecurity startup Wiz for around $23 billion. This would be Alphabet’s largest acquisition ever.
- **Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft**: The US is considering stricter trade restrictions against China, which has caused a significant sell-off in microchip stocks, impacting the "Magnificent 7" tech giants, including Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft.

**Stock Impact:**
- **Google (Alphabet)**: The potential acquisition of Wiz could bolster Alphabet's cloud computing efforts and enhance its cybersecurity capabilities. However, antitrust scrutiny remains a risk.

**Action:**
- **Google (Alphabet)**: **Buy or Hold**. The acquisition of Wiz could provide significant growth in the cybersecurity space. Monitor antitrust developments.
