Investing can be a daunting task, but it doesn't have to be complicated. One strategy that many investors find effective is building a solid core portfolio using [mutual funds](./2023-12-08-Mutual-Funds) or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In this article, we'll explore the benefits of allocating 80% or more of your investment portfolio to core funds, specifically focusing on total stock market, S&P 500, and international funds. Additionally, we'll delve into the advantages of complementing your core with individual stocks for those seeking extra returns, diversified holdings, and strategic tax planning.

# The 80% Rule: Core Mutual Funds

## Total Stock Market Funds:

Total stock market funds provide investors with exposure to the entire stock market, capturing a broad spectrum of companies, from large-cap to small-cap. This diversification helps mitigate risk by spreading investments across various sectors and industries. These funds are an excellent foundation for long-term growth, aligning with the principle of "don't put all your eggs in one basket."

## S&P 500 Funds:

S&P 500 funds track the performance of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. These blue-chip stocks are known for stability and consistent growth over time. Investing in S&P 500 funds allows you to participate in the overall health of the U.S. economy and benefit from the growth potential of leading companies.

## International Funds:

Diversification isn't limited to domestic markets. International funds broaden your investment horizon by including companies from around the world. This provides exposure to different economic cycles and can act as a hedge against downturns in specific regions. Including international funds in your core portfolio adds an extra layer of risk mitigation.

# Beyond the Core: Adding Individual Stocks

While a robust core is crucial, there are compelling reasons to consider adding individual stocks to your portfolio.

## Pulling Out Extra Returns

Individual stocks offer the potential for outsized returns compared to the broader market. Savvy investors can identify undervalued stocks or those with significant growth potential, leading to higher returns than what might be achieved through core funds alone.

## Varied Holdings

Adding individual stocks allows you to tailor your portfolio to your specific investment goals and beliefs. Whether you're interested in tech innovation, sustainable energy, or other niche sectors, individual stock selection gives you the freedom to shape your portfolio according to your preferences.

## Tax Planning

Tax efficiency is a crucial consideration in any investment strategy. Individual stocks provide greater control over your capital gains and losses, allowing for strategic tax planning. Unlike mutual funds, which may distribute capital gains to all investors, holding individual stocks enables you to manage your tax liability more effectively.

## The Challenge and Fun of Stock Picking

Investing can be both challenging and enjoyable. While the core of your portfolio provides stability, the excitement of researching and selecting individual stocks adds an element of challenge and engagement. Remember, in the world of investing, sometimes "boring" wins in the long run.

# Conclusion

Building a successful investment portfolio doesn't have to be complex. By allocating a significant portion to core mutual funds or ETFs and strategically complementing them with individual stocks, investors can achieve a balanced approach that combines stability and growth potential. Remember, the key is to align your investment strategy with your financial goals and risk tolerance, creating a path to financial success that suits your unique needs.
