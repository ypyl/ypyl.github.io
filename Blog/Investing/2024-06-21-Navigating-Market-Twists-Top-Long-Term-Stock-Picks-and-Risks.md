### Long-Term Investment Recommendations:

#### Buy:
1. **Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)**:
   - **Reason**: Nvidia has become the most valuable company in the world, driven by the AI revolution and its dominance in the AI chip market. With projections to potentially reach a market value of $5 trillion, Nvidia's consistent outperformance and growth potential make it a strong buy.

2. **General Electric Company (GE)**:
   - **Reason**: GE Aerospace is developing a hybrid-electric engine aimed at reducing the aviation industry's carbon emissions. This innovation aligns with the global push for net-zero emissions by 2050, positioning GE as a leader in sustainable aviation technology.

3. **Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)**:
   - **Reason**: Despite being surpassed by Nvidia, Microsoft's robust position in cloud computing, AI, and productivity software continues to make it a solid long-term investment. Its strategic acquisitions and innovation in AI keep it competitive and growing.

4. **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**:
   - **Reason**: As one of the world's leading technology companies, Apple's continuous innovation in consumer electronics and services ensures its strong market position. Despite Nvidia's recent ascent, Apple remains a key player with significant growth potential.

5. **The Walt Disney Company (DIS)**:
   - **Reason**: Disney and Pixar's recent box office success with "Inside Out 2" demonstrates the company's strong content creation capabilities and market appeal. Continued success in entertainment and strategic expansions in streaming services make Disney a worthwhile investment.

#### Sell:
1. **Boeing Co. (BA)**:
   - **Reason**: Boeing is facing numerous challenges, including technical issues, whistleblower allegations, and scrutiny from regulatory bodies. The negative publicity, combined with significant financial losses and operational setbacks, suggests it might be prudent to reduce exposure to Boeing.

2. **Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)**:
   - **Reason**: Tesla's recent diversion of AI processors meant for its automotive projects to its social media venture, X, has caused delays and investor concerns. This, coupled with potential governance challenges, suggests caution and possible reduction of holdings in Tesla.

3. **Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)**:
   - **Reason**: The ongoing lawsuit and criticisms regarding Meta's handling of content and potential biases pose reputational and financial risks. These challenges could affect investor confidence and stock performance, making it a candidate for selling.

4. **Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)**:
   - **Reason**: The alliance between the Amazon Labour Union and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters could lead to increased labor costs and operational disruptions. These potential challenges, coupled with ongoing scrutiny over labor practices, suggest a cautious approach.

5. **Nike, Inc. (NKE)**:
   - **Reason**: With earnings reports expected soon, any negative surprises or underperformance could lead to a dip in stock price. Recent market conditions and consumer behavior trends might pose risks, making it a candidate for reducing exposure ahead of the report.
