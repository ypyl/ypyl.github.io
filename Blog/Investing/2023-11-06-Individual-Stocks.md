# Individual stocks

Investing in individual stocks involves purchasing shares of specific companies, effectively becoming a partial owner of those companies. Unlike other investment options like mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), where you own a basket of various stocks, individual stock investment is more focused. When you invest in individual stocks, you're betting on the success and growth of a particular company. This type of investment grants you the autonomy to choose which companies you want to invest in and allows you to directly benefit from their performance in the stock market.

Let's explore the pros and cons of individual stock investments:

## Advantages

**Control**: Individual stocks offer more control. You can decide when to buy and sell, allowing you to adapt to market conditions as needed.

**Tax Efficiency**: They can be tax-efficient since you have the freedom to time your sales for tax optimization.

**Targeted Approach**: You can take a precise approach by selecting companies that align with your goals and values.

## Drawbacks

**Less Diversification**: Individual stocks are inherently less diversified, which means your portfolio's performance is closely tied to individual company performance.

**Hands-On Approach**: Managing individual stocks requires a hands-on approach. Extensive research and continuous monitoring are essential.

## Diversification

To diversify your portfolio when investing in individual stocks, consider holding 20-30 different stocks. However, it's crucial to diversify thoughtfully:

Achieve greater diversification by considering:

**Industry**: Invest in various industries to reduce sector-specific risks.

**Size**: Diversify by company size, including large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks.

**Style**: Explore different investment styles, such as growth, value, or income-focused companies, to create a well-rounded portfolio.
