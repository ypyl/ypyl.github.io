# Stock diversification

Stock diversification options involve strategies to spread investments across various stocks, reducing risk and potentially boosting returns.

## Company Size Diversification

Balance investments among large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies to manage size-related risks. It's calculated by multiplying the current stock price by the total number of outstanding shares. This straightforward equation offers valuable insights into a company's scale and standing in the financial markets.

Companies are typically categorized into three general cap ranges based on their market cap values:

- Large Cap ($10 Billion+): These are the industry giants, with market capitalizations exceeding $10 billion. Large-cap companies are often well-established, financially robust, and widely recognized. They tend to offer stability and lower risk, making them appealing to conservative investors.

- Mid Cap ($2-10 Billion): Falling in the middle of the spectrum, mid-cap companies have market caps ranging from $2 billion to $10 billion. They offer a balance between growth potential and stability. Investors interested in moderate risk and return profiles often consider mid-cap stocks for diversification.

- Small Cap (<$2 Billion): Small-cap companies, with market caps under $2 billion, are often characterized by their growth prospects and higher volatility. Investing in small caps can be riskier but offers the potential for substantial returns. They are typically considered by investors seeking a more aggressive investment approach.
