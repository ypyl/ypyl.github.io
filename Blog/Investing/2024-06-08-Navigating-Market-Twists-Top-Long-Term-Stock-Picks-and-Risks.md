### Long-Term Investment Recommendations:

### Buy:

1. **Paramount (PARA)**
   - **Reason**: Paramount is currently undervalued, down 16.6% year-to-date despite positive news surrounding its acquisition by Skydance Media. The $8 billion deal and strategic backing by RedBird Capital Partners and KKR suggest strong future potential and stability. Additionally, Shari Redstone's preference for keeping the company whole indicates confidence in its long-term prospects.

2. **Broadcom (AVGO)**
   - **Reason**: Broadcom has a strong track record of performance and is expected to release its earnings report next week. The company's consistent growth in the semiconductor industry, coupled with its recent acquisitions and partnerships, make it a solid long-term investment. The upcoming earnings report may also provide positive catalysts for the stock.

### Sell:

1. **GameStop (GME)**
   - **Reason**: Despite the recent surge in GameStop's share price due to Keith Gill's (Roaring Kitty) involvement, the stock remains highly volatile and speculative. The potential for market manipulation and the ongoing investigations by regulatory bodies add significant risk. For long-term investors seeking stability, this stock is not advisable.

2. **Boeing (BA)**
   - **Reason**: Boeing's stock has faced a rough year, down almost 25% due to ongoing technical issues, regulatory investigations, and other operational setbacks. Although the successful Starliner mission is a positive development, the overall risk and uncertainty surrounding the company make it a less attractive long-term investment at this time.
