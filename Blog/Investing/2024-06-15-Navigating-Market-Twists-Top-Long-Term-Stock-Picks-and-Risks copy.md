#### Long-Term Investment Recommendations:

**Buy:**

**Meta Platforms Inc. (META)**

**Reason:** Meta has shown remarkable resilience and growth, surging over 450% since its 2022 low. The company is considered a prime candidate for a stock split, which can make shares more accessible to everyday investors and potentially lead to further stock appreciation. Meta's ongoing investments in AI and robust financial performance make it a strong long-term investment.

**Apple Inc. (AAPL)**

**Reason:** Despite a slight dip post-AI announcement, Apple's stock had a significant rally leading up to its developer conference. The introduction of "Apple Intelligence" and other innovative features positions Apple well in the competitive AI landscape. With a market valuation of over $3 trillion and a history of strong financial performance, Apple remains a solid choice for long-term investors.

**Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)**

**Reason:** Nvidia's recent 10-for-1 stock split and subsequent 28% gain highlight its strong market position and growth potential. The company's leadership in AI and semiconductor technology continues to drive its success. Nvidia's strategic moves and robust financial health make it a compelling long-term investment.

**Sell:**

**Paramount Global (PARA)**

**Reason:** The collapse of the merger with Skydance Media creates uncertainty around Paramount's future. The breakdown of negotiations and the resulting strain on their partnership highlight potential operational and strategic challenges. The media industry's volatility and Paramount's current instability make it a less attractive long-term investment.

**Intel Corp. (INTC)**

**Reason:** Intel's decision to slow down its $25 billion chip-manufacturing plant project in Israel and its cost-saving measures indicate potential financial strain and strategic redirection. The sale of a significant stake in its Irish plant further suggests challenges in managing its global investments. Given these uncertainties, Intel may pose higher risks for long-term investors seeking stability.

#### Summary:
These recommendations reflect the potential for growth and stability in companies like Meta, Apple, and Nvidia, driven by their strategic initiatives and market positions. Conversely, Paramount and Intel face significant challenges that may impact their long-term performance, making them less favorable for investors focused on long-term gains. Always consider your financial situation and seek professional advice before making investment decisions.
