Do you like listen radio? Have you installed dotnet core locally? So there is a nice dotnet tool "plr" to listen radio!

To install:

```bat
dotnet tool install --global plr
```

Listen

* using powershell:

```bat
start radio
```

* using cmd

```bat
radio
```

Common way to start listening the first radio from the list:

-p 1
```

To see supported commands:
