# Strategy: Mutual Fund or ETF core

- 80%+ in core mutual funds (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund)
    - total stock market
    - S&P 500
    - international
- add individuals stocks around core
    - pull out extra return
    - varied holdings (advantantages of individuals)
    - tax reasons (mutual fund distrbution)
    - challenging and fun (boring wins)

# how many individuals stocks should I own?

- too few
    - not diversified
    - more downside risk
- too many
    - over diversification
    - hard to track
    - less potentional reward

- traditional 20-30 individuals stocks

- study found that portfolio containing 12 to 18 stocks provide aout 90% of the maximum benefits of diversification

- no holding more than 5% of total capital invested =20
    - ex, 10000$ invested then 500$ per stock

- no holding more than 2% of total capital invested =50
    - ex, 10000$ invested then 200$ per stock

- diversify by sector (ex. healthcare) and industry (ex, biotechnology) and variety of both (ex, BioTech, EV, Technology, Banks, ..)

- use ETF or Mututal funds for instant diversification

# 15 key financial ratios to look at when buying sticks

- where do rarios come from?
    - balance sheet
    - income statement
    - cash flow statement
- important to compare within industry
- some rarios more important to some industries than others
    - ex, inventory turn
- some rarios more important to stock type than others
    - ex, dividend yield
- hundreds of ratios. Focused on key ones (paralysis by analysis)
- ratios are quick ways to evaluate a stock
- ratio categories
    - valuation (price)
        - valuation ratios try to answer one question:
            - is the price I am paying for a stock a good price?
                - fair price?
                - really good (bargain)
                - overpriced (stay away)
            - considerations
                - higher stock price does not mean it is a better to buy today
                - good to compare companees against competitors
                - some raties may work better than others for certain companies
                    - ex, p/e no good for companies who have no earnings (losing money)
        - Price to earnings ratio (P/E)
            - what you need: income statement, most recent stock price
            - the formula: p/e = price per share / earning per share
            - what it means: think of the price to earnings ratio as the price you will pay for $` od earning
            - a very general rule of thumb is that shares trading at 'low P/E are a value, though the definition of 'low' varies from industry to industry
        - PEG ratio
            - what you need: income statement, most recent stock price
            - the formula: peg = (p/e ratio) / projected annual growth in earnings per share
            - what it means: the peg ratio uses the basic format of the p/e ratio for a numerator and then divides by the potential growth for EPS, which you will have to estimate. The two ratios may seem to be very similar but the PEG raito is able to take into account future earnings growth
            - a very generally rule of thumb is that any PEG ratio below 1.0 is considered to be a good value
        - Price to Sale
            - stock price divided by sales per share
            - can be used with any company but very helpful for companies that do not have recent positive earnings (have losses) like companies having a momentary downtrend or new and emerging companies who are not profitable yet. Think early days of a tech company like Amazon and Tesla
            - proc
                - less susceptible to accounting shenanigans. More difficult to massage or adjust like you legally can with earnings possibly
                - relatively stable metric, revenue is generally more stable than something like earnings, which can be more volatile
            - cons
                - it doesn't take profitability into account
            - what is a good P/S?
                - range of 1.0-2.0
                - less than 1.0 is excellent
        - Price to book
            - ratio of price to book value per share
            - book value is the value of an asset according to its balance sheet account - in other words, it is a company's value if it liquidated its assets and paid back its liabilities
            - when to use P/B
                - relied on by 'value investors' looking to find good companies (as represented by their book value and future possible prospects) relative to their current price per share
                - it can also be used dureing periods of negative earnings. If a company has several periods of negative earnings, they likely still have a positive book value
            - proc
                - stable metric: given the relative stability of the base metric (book value), this ratio doesn't fluctuate as much as others
            - cons
                - accounting differences can make it hard to compare. It becomes less useful when companies classify items on their balance sheet differently due to different interpretations of accounting rules. Harder to compare companies with little tabgible assets (tech firms, service providers) against those with lots of inventory or equipment (retailers, automobile)
            - what is a good P/B?
                - of 1.0 - 3.0
                - less than 1.0 is excellent
        - EV/Revenue ratio
            - it is calculated as enterprise value/revenue, where enterprise value = market capitalization + debt - cash and cash equivalents; revenue = total annual revenue
            - this multiple is commonly used for early stage or high-growth business that do not yet have positive earnings, alternative to ratios as P/E, PEG and EV/EBITDA
    - profitability
    - liquidity
    - debt (solvency)
    - efficiency (operating)
