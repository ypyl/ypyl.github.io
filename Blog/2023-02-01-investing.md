I am writing an article about investment. I am trying to keep it simple and straightforward.

Currently, I am writing about "Mutual funds". There are my topics that I want to cover in the article:

```
- pool of investors
    - sharing risk and reward
- diversified holdings
    - sometime asserts classes
- professional management
    - avtive vs index
- liquidity
    - easy to buy and sell
```

Write an article that cover mentioned topics and expand them with additional information.


# Active vs Index funds

- index fund means you are trying to match the market that the index follows
- ex, vanguard S%P 500 Index fund
- index fund advantages
    - lower cost
    - potentional for more diversification
- index fund disadvantages
    - no fund manager with vested interest
    - index down as a whole
    - can be less diversified
    - can be heave weighted in a few positions (ex, S&P 500)

# Mutual fund expenses

- sales charges (load)
    - front end/back end 3$ or more

- market undervalued
    - recent bad news-sell off
    - long-term fundamentals good
- key ratios (compare to average)
    - lower price to book
    - lower price to earnings (P/E)
    - high dividend yeild
- future growth-cach flow
- contrarian investing
- very subjective
    - investor A thinks stock is undervalued

    - PEG value < 1 and prefer near .5
        - PEG is favorite measure for GAPR

# Technical analysis charting and mementum

- not looking for fundamentals
- looking at past movement (ex, price or volume) to predict future
- very much a trading tool
- assumptions
    - market price is the actual price as all information known (no value invest)
    - price movements are not random

# Dogs of the Dow

- the fogs of the dow are the 10 of the 30 USA Fortune 500 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial average with the highest dividend yield
- idea is good stocks (why they are in the DOW) who are out of favor
    - thus low price-higher dividend yield
- each year rebalance to select new 10

# Dividend aristocrats

- S&P 500 companies that have increased dividend for 25 straight years
- strong in rising markets and extra strong and safe in falling markets

# 15 key financial ratios to look at when buying sticks

- where do rarios come from?
    - balance sheet
    - income statement
    - cash flow statement
- important to compare within industry
- some rarios more important to some industries than others
    - ex, inventory turn
- some rarios more important to stock type than others
    - ex, dividend yield
- hundreds of ratios. Focused on key ones (paralysis by analysis)
- ratios are quick ways to evaluate a stock
- ratio categories
    - valuation (price)
        - valuation ratios try to answer one question:
            - is the price I am paying for a stock a good price?
                - fair price?
                - really good (bargain)
                - overpriced (stay away)
            - considerations
                - higher stock price does not mean it is a better to buy today
                - good to compare companees against competitors
                - some raties may work better than others for certain companies
                    - ex, p/e no good for companies who have no earnings (losing money)
        - Price to earnings ratio (P/E)
            - what you need: income statement, most recent stock price
            - the formula: p/e = price per share / earning per share
            - what it means: think of the price to earnings ratio as the price you will pay for $` od earning
            - a very general rule of thumb is that shares trading at 'low P/E are a value, though the definition of 'low' varies from industry to industry
        - PEG ratio
            - what you need: income statement, most recent stock price
            - the formula: peg = (p/e ratio) / projected annual growth in earnings per share
            - what it means: the peg ratio uses the basic format of the p/e ratio for a numerator and then divides by the potential growth for EPS, which you will have to estimate. The two ratios may seem to be very similar but the PEG raito is able to take into account future earnings growth
            - a very generally rule of thumb is that any PEG ratio below 1.0 is considered to be a good value
        - Price to Sale
            - stock price divided by sales per share
            - can be used with any company but very helpful for companies that do not have recent positive earnings (have losses) like companies having a momentary downtrend or new and emerging companies who are not profitable yet. Think early days of a tech company like Amazon and Tesla
            - proc
                - less susceptible to accounting shenanigans. More difficult to massage or adjust like you legally can with earnings possibly
                - relatively stable metric, revenue is generally more stable than something like earnings, which can be more volatile
            - cons
                - it doesn't take profitability into account
            - what is a good P/S?
                - range of 1.0-2.0
                - less than 1.0 is excellent
        - Price to book
            - ratio of price to book value per share
            - book value is the value of an asset according to its balance sheet account - in other words, it is a company's value if it liquidated its assets and paid back its liabilities
            - when to use P/B
                - relied on by 'value investors' looking to find good companies (as represented by their book value and future possible prospects) relative to their current price per share
                - it can also be used dureing periods of negative earnings. If a company has several periods of negative earnings, they likely still have a positive book value
            - proc
                - stable metric: given the relative stability of the base metric (book value), this ratio doesn't fluctuate as much as others
            - cons
                - accounting differences can make it hard to compare. It becomes less useful when companies classify items on their balance sheet differently due to different interpretations of accounting rules. Harder to compare companies with little tabgible assets (tech firms, service providers) against those with lots of inventory or equipment (retailers, automobile)
            - what is a good P/B?
                - of 1.0 - 3.0
                - less than 1.0 is excellent
        - EV/Revenue ratio
            - it is calculated as enterprise value/revenue, where enterprise value = market capitalization + debt - cash and cash equivalents; revenue = total annual revenue
            - this multiple is commonly used for early stage or high-growth business that do not yet have positive earnings, alternative to ratios as P/E, PEG and EV/EBITDA
    - profitability
        - return on asset (ROA)
            - a company buys assets in order to conduct its business. ROA tells how good the company is at using its assets to make money.
        - return on equity (ROE)
            - equity is another word for ownership ROE tells you how good company is at rewarding its shareholders for their investment.
            - higher is better
        - profit margin
            - how much of company total sales flow through to the bottom line
            - higher is better
            - important to compare between companies within one category
    - liquidity
        - current and quick ratio

            - selll off assets
            - take on more debts
            - cot or eliminate their dividend
        - what can happen if cannot cover their debts?
            - stock price down
            - bankruptcy
        - current ratio
            - current assets / current liabilities
            - assets - cash, accounts receivable, inventory, all stuff expected turned into cach in less than one year
            - liabilities - one year payments
            - bigger than 1 value is good (can cover debts)
        - quick ratio
            - higher is better
            - A good ratio to see if a company can pay its current bills or debts that are coming
            - more conservative that current
            - looks at assets that are more liquid
            - best to compare against peers
            - https://finviz.com/
    - debt (solvency)
        - debt to equity

### Moving Average

### Chart Patterns: Rectangles

- Trading range bounded by:
    - support line (bottom)
    - resistance line (top)
- until there is a breakout of the rectangle
- After breakout usually moves in direction on previous trend but not always

### Chart Patterns: Triangles (Continuation and Descending)

## Risk Measures

- risk = reward
- volatility - the degree to which a stock's price move

### Pair stock this with your own personal view of risk

### Sharpe ratio

- adjusts a portfolio past performance - or expercted future performance - for the excess risk that was taken by the investor
- removing the rate of return on a 'risk-free' investment, as US treasure bond or t-bill, from the expreienced rate of return
- how much more risk will be taken comparing with 'risk-free' investment
- above 1.0 is good  you are getting excess returns relative to its volatility. But consider the peers in its class
- sortino ratio (more conservative type)
- treynor ratio (how successful an investmetn is in providing compensation to investors for taking on investment risk)

### Beta

- measures the amount of risk (volatility) an individual security, mutual fund or ETF has relative to a broder index
- cash has Beta 0

### Alpha

- more of a performance measure
- refers to excess returns earned on an investment above the benchmark or index return
- positive means outperformed the broadex index
- you could have situation where you have a high alpha, but the beta vilatility is too much for your investment tastes or goals

### R-Squared

- is a statistical measure that represents the percentage of a mutual fund portfolio or a security movements that **can be explained by or attributed** to movements in a benchmark index
- between 85 and 100 has a performance record that is closely correlated to the index
- less 70 does not perform like the index

### Standard deviation

- statically, measures the dispertion of data from its expetected value
- higher standard diviations, the greated the possible outcomes, high and low, thus more volatility

### Broader risk categories: systematic and un-systematic risk

- systematic risk is associated with the broader market
- un-systematic risk is assosiated with a particular company, industry or secor
