**When you are travelling (in car, train and etc)** - let the world to swim in front of you, do not "jump eyes" from one object to another and "cling to look."

**When watching TV** glance over the surface of the screen periodically, as if you are looking out the window and look at the screen glass.

**Closing** eyes for 3-5 seconds and easy fast twinkle are improving blood circulation.

It is **useful to look at the flame of a burning candle** - up to 15 minutes.

It would be good to **get enough sleep**!

You should take small breaks as often as possible when working at computer or with papers. During the pause you can do a little gymnastics for the eyes:

*Each exercise is performed 5-10 times in each direction, 1-2 times a day*

Thanks.
