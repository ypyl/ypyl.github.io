1. xAI launched the world's first 1 GW AI training cluster, to increase to 1.5 GW by April. Comparable to half of Los Angeles' energy consumption. Other hyperscalers follow: OpenAI building 1.2 GW Stargate in Texas (launch 2026+), Anthropic scaling from 245 MW to 2.295 GW across sites.

2. Spirit AI released Spirit v1.5, a top vision-language-action model for robots combining vision, understanding, and motor control. Ranked #1 on RoboChallenge Table30, surpassing previous leader Pi0.5. Potential to enable mass "awakening" of robots by 2026. [Spirit AI blog](https://spirit-ai.com/en/blog/spirit-v1-5)

3. Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman predicts within 5 years everyone will have an AI companion deeply understanding their context, senses, emotions, and preferences — becoming a persistent second layer of reality, not just a tool.

4. ZAI released GLM-4.7 Flash, a lightweight 30B parameter MoE model with 128K token context window, optimized for coding, DevOps, and aesthetics. Outperforms competitors in SWE-bench (59.2%) and AIME 25 (91.6%). Open source under MIT license. Suitable for local deployment with GPUs or quantized versions.

5. Google revealed the main bottleneck for new data centers is physical connection to the transmission grid, with wait times up to 10-12 years for interconnection. AI growth now limited by grid capacity, permitting, and construction delays, not GPUs or power contracts. By 2026, securing megawatt-scale grid connections will be the critical constraint for AI scaling.
