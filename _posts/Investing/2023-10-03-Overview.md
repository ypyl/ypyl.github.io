# Getting Started with Investing: An Overview

Investing in the stock market can be risky, and there's no guarantee of making money. However, think of it like a game of skill, similar to poker. In this game, the best players often come out on top by making smart choices.

## A Quick Look at Choosing Stocks

When you're beginning to invest, it's a good idea to start with companies you're familiar with.

Before you buy stocks in a particular company, try to answer these questions:

- What makes this company special compared to others?
- Are the stocks affordable or high-priced?
- Does the company have a well-known brand or reputation (good or bad)?

By considering these factors, you'll feel more confident in selecting stocks that suit your preferences.

## Examining Ratios

When it comes to choosing the right stocks, there are many ratios and indicators to consider. However, two primary ratios are commonly checked to answer the question, "Is the price I'm paying for a stock reasonable compared to another stock?":

- Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio (lower is better, under 25 is good)
- Price/Sales (P/S) Ratio (lower is better, under 2.0 is good)

These ratios provide valuable insights into a stock's value.

## Technical Analysis: Predicting Short-Term Price Trends

Technical analysis focuses solely on historical price and volume data to predict short-term price movements in the stock market. Traders look for recurring patterns, like head and shoulders or double tops, in price charts to make predictions. This approach is ideal for short-term trading and requires continuous learning and risk management. Moving averages, along with various indicators, play a crucial role in technical analysis.
