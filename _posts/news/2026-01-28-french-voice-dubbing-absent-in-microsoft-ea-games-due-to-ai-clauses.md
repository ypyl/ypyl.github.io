Several Microsoft and EA games, including The Elder Scrolls Online, World of Warcraft, Apex Legends, and Forza Horizon 6, are missing French voice dubbing. This absence stems from French voice actors refusing to sign new contracts containing clauses on the use of generative AI, which they fear threaten their profession.

The French actors' unions have highlighted that current contract clauses do not sufficiently protect against the use of their voice recordings for AI training or synthetic voice generation. As a result, some actors have halted dubbing work, emphasizing their desire to protect their craft from AI exploitation.

Players have reacted with petitions and legal complaints, demanding the return of French dubbing. Meanwhile, publishers have yet to publicly address the issue.
