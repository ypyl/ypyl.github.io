OpenAI has released the Codex AI tool as a native application, moving away from the terminal interface and IDE plugins. The app supports multiple agents working simultaneously on the same repository, skill creation and usage within the UI, and automation capabilities such as scheduling tasks based on chat analysis.

Currently available on macOS, Windows and Linux users can join a waitlist. Codex is accessible to ChatGPT Free and Go subscribers, with doubled request limits for Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Edu users.
