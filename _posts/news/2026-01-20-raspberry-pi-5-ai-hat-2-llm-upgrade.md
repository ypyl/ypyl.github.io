Raspberry Pi has launched the AI HAT+ 2, an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi 5 that enables local execution of large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Powered by the Hailo-10H accelerator delivering 40 TOPS of INT4 inference power and featuring 8GB of onboard memory, the AI HAT+ 2 supports larger models without using system RAM. It connects via PCIe and GPIO, offering high-bandwidth data transfer but is not compatible with Raspberry Pi 4.

This upgrade enhances generative AI capabilities on the Pi, allowing tasks like text-based Q&A, code generation, translation, and visual scene descriptions to run locally with low latency and privacy benefits. The AI HAT+ 2 costs $130 and targets edge deployments requiring on-device AI processing.
