Singapore has launched the world's first **Model AI Governance Framework for Agentic AI**, announced by Minister Josephine Teo at the World Economic Forum. Developed by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), the framework guides organisations on responsible deployment of agentic AI, emphasizing human accountability and risk mitigation.

The framework addresses unique risks posed by AI agents, such as unauthorized actions and automation bias, by recommending technical and non-technical controls across four key areas: risk assessment, human accountability, technical safeguards, and user transparency. It aims to balance innovation with safety and is a living document open to feedback and case study submissions.

This initiative supports Singapore's broader goal to establish a trusted AI ecosystem globally and regionally, collaborating through the AI Safety Institute and ASEAN Working Group on AI Governance.
