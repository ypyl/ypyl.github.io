Thomas Dohmke has announced the launch of Entire, a new company building the next developer platform designed for AI-driven software development. Backed by a $60 million seed round, Entire aims to reinvent the software development lifecycle by integrating human and AI agent collaboration through a git-compatible database and a universal semantic reasoning layer.

Their first product, the open source Entire CLI, introduces "Checkpoints," a system that captures agent context alongside code commits to preserve the reasoning and decisions behind AI-generated code. This innovation addresses current limitations in software development tools that were not designed for agent-driven coding workflows.

Entire's CLI currently supports Anthropic's Claude Code and Google Gemini CLI, with plans to add more agents soon. The company emphasizes openness and community-driven development, inviting feedback via Discord and GitHub Discussions.
