This partnership was notable for the researchers adapting their AI tools daily to meet the creative needs of the artists, while the artists influenced the development of these experimental technologies. The collaboration allowed artists to discover new creative possibilities and gave researchers hands-on experience in overcoming artistic and technical challenges.
