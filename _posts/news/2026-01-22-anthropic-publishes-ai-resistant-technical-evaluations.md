Anthropic has released a blog post by Tristan Hume, lead of their optimization team, detailing their approach to AI-resistant technical evaluations for hiring. The new test assignments aim to reflect real work challenges by allowing candidates to use AI assistants while emphasizing human reasoning on out-of-distribution tasks inspired by Zachtronics puzzle games.

Key points include:
- Designing realistic and multi-part assignments that simulate novel work.
- Encouraging candidates to build debugging tools themselves instead of providing them upfront.
- Balancing AI assistance with human creativity and problem-solving.
- Early results show strong correlation with candidate experience and improved evaluation quality.

Anthropic's approach highlights the growing complexity of tech hiring in the AI era and the need for innovative evaluation methods. [Source](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/AI-resistant-technical-evaluations)
