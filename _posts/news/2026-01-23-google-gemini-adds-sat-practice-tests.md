Google has enhanced its Gemini AI assistant with SAT practice tests developed in collaboration with The Princeton Review. Users can start a full digital SAT simulation lasting 2 hours and 14 minutes by saying, "I want to take a practice SAT test."

The tool not only provides a final score after the test but also analyzes mistakes, explains difficult concepts, and creates a personalized study plan to address knowledge gaps. Various modes are available, from strict timed simulations to assisted learning with hints, with plans to add more formalized tests in the future.
