OpenAI has released an update for the GPT-5.2 Instant model, focusing on improving the quality of generated responses. The update makes answers more balanced and places the most important information at the beginning of instructions and advice.

GPT-5.2 Instant is a non-reasoning model used in ChatGPT either manually or automatically when tasks are simple or when users exhaust their reasoning model limits. The update is now available in the ChatGPT web interface and via API under the alias gpt-5.2-chat-latest.
