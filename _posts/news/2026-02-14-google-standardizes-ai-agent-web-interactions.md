Google has introduced **WebMCP**, a protocol implementation designed to standardize how AI agents interact with websites. WebMCP provides a predictable interface that replaces fragile page parsing, enabling faster and more reliable agent operations.

Websites can offer structured tools such as ticket booking, support request creation, and product search through two main APIs: a declarative API for simple actions via HTML forms and an imperative API for complex JavaScript-driven scenarios. Currently, WebMCP is available as a developer preview through Google's early access program.

Future plans include integration with Chrome and Gemini, allowing AI agents to perform actions directly within the browser without user intervention.
