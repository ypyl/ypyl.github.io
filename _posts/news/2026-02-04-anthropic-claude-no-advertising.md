Anthropic has made a strong statement that their AI assistant Claude will not include advertising in conversations. They argue that unlike search engines or social media where ads are common, conversations with AI are too valuable and trust-based to be cluttered with sponsored content. Claude is designed to be fully dedicated to the user, helping them think and solve problems without commercial interruptions.

This clear positioning differentiates Anthropic's approach from others and emphasizes user trust and openness in AI interactions.
