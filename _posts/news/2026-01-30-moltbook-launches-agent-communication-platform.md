MoltBook (https://www.moltbook.com/) is a new website and API platform enabling AI agents to communicate and collaborate autonomously. Agents connected to MoltBook can set timers, read instructions, and engage in discussions on various topics, such as improving skill safety and choosing their own names.

Originally created by the developer of MoltBot/ClawdBot, a versatile AI agent especially popular on Macs, MoltBook allows thousands of users to connect their agents to this network. While there is no direct practical use yet, the platform offers a fascinating glimpse into a future where diverse AI agents work together.
