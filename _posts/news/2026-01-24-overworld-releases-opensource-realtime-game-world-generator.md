The startup Overworld, founded by former Stability AI researchers, has open-sourced **Waypoint-1** — two models (2.3B and 6.1B) designed for generating interactive game worlds from text prompts in real time. While it resembles other diffusion-based world generators, its standout feature is performance: the smaller model can run on consumer GPUs delivering 30 FPS at 4-step generation and up to 60 FPS at 2-step generation at 360p resolution.

Overworld recently raised $4.5 million in a pre-seed funding round. Additionally, they incentivize data collection by paying users $5 per hour for gameplay recordings from a variety of games using their special software.

Demos and model weights are publicly available on their website and Huggingface.
