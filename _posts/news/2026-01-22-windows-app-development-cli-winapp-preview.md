Microsoft has announced the public preview of **winapp**, a new open-source command-line tool designed to simplify Windows app development across multiple frameworks and toolchains. The CLI streamlines environment setup, manifest and certificate management, and MSIX packaging with single commands, making Windows development more accessible.

Key features include one-command environment setup, adding package identity for debugging, and direct integration with Electron for native Windows code access. Developers can install winapp via WinGet or npm for Electron projects and access guides on GitHub.

This tool aims to reduce configuration complexity and enhance developer productivity while supporting modern Windows APIs, including AI and security features.
