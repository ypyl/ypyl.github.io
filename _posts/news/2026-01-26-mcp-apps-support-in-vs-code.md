The MCP community has introduced MCP Apps, the first official MCP extension that brings interactive UI components directly into AI coding agent conversations. These components, such as dashboards, forms, and visualizations, enable richer and more effective collaboration between humans and AI agents.

VS Code Insiders is the first major AI code editor to support MCP Apps, allowing developers to experience these new interactive features immediately. The feature is expected to roll out to VS Code Stable in the following week's release.

This advancement enhances AI agents' capabilities beyond code editing and terminal commands to include interactive visual tools, improving productivity and user experience.
