A year after the term "vibe coding" popularized by Andrej Karpata, Anthropic's CEO Scott White introduced the new concept of "vibe working." This reflects the significant advancements in AI models, which now handle much more than just code generation, signaling a broader delegation of tasks to AI.

Analysts see this as a key turning point, with Claude Code marking the rise of AI "Agents" and hinting at the future role of AI in the workplace. The term "vibe working" captures the evolving relationship between humans and AI as automation expands beyond software development.
