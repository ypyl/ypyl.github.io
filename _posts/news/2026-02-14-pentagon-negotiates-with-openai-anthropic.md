The Pentagon is in talks with OpenAI and Anthropic to deploy their AI models, including GPT and Claude, across classified military networks. The U.S. Department of Defense seeks to lift most restrictions and ethical filters on these models for use in sensitive environments. OpenAI has already launched ChatGPT on the genai.mil platform, used by over 3 million Pentagon employees, with some restrictions removed but security guarantees maintained. However, Anthropic remains firm on adhering to its usage policies and opposes using Claude for combat and intelligence purposes.
