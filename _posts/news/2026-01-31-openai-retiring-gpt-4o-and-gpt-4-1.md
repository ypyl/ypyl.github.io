OpenAI announced that it will retire GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and their mini versions from the ChatGPT model selection menu starting February 13, 2026. Despite their phase-out on ChatGPT, these models will remain available for API users.

The decision comes as GPT-4o accounts for only 0.1% of daily traffic, and OpenAI encourages users to transition to the newer GPT-5.1 and 5.2 models, which offer customizable response tones. Additionally, OpenAI plans to address false refusals and introduce an adult version of ChatGPT with less restrictive content filters.
