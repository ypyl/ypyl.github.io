OpenAI is looking to diversify its revenue streams beyond the standard ChatGPT subscription model amid rising costs, according to CFO Sarah Friar. The company plans to license its models and take a share of revenue if clients achieve commercial success, such as discovering a drug with OpenAI's technology.

Additionally, OpenAI aims to introduce more flexible pricing plans including enterprise SaaS pricing and usage or credit-based models. The company is also preparing to test advertising in ChatGPT while ensuring that answers remain optimal and not ad-driven, and will keep an ad-free subscription tier available.

This approach reflects OpenAI's strategy to monetize not only through subscriptions but also by sharing in client success and offering adaptable pricing.
