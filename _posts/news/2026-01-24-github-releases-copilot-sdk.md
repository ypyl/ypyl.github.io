GitHub has opened access to the agent capabilities of Copilot through a new SDK, currently available in technical preview. This SDK enables developers to embed GitHub Copilot CLI's agent functionalities into their own applications, saving them from building task planning and orchestration logic from scratch.

The SDK supports Node.js, Python, Go, and .NET, handling infrastructure aspects such as authentication, model switching, data streaming, and integration with the MCP protocol. Installation instructions, examples, and SDK references are available in the repository at [GitHub Copilot SDK](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk/).

An active GitHub Copilot subscription is required to use the SDK.
