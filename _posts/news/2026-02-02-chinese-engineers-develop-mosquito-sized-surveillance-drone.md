Chinese engineers have unveiled a mosquito-sized drone designed for surveillance tasks. Measuring just 0.6 cm in length and weighing around 0.3 grams, this tiny drone flaps its wings 500 times per second, can record video and audio, and transmits data in real-time. Combining biomimicry, microengineering, and AI precision, the drone is nearly invisible and extremely difficult to detect.

While a remarkable technological breakthrough, the concept raises concerns about privacy as surveillance devices could be concealed within insects.
