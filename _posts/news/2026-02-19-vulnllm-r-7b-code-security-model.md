A new reasoning language model, **VulnLLM-R-7B**, has been released for code security, designed to detect vulnerabilities like a pentester. Unlike traditional models that search for suspicious patterns, VulnLLM-R-7B analyzes data flow and control flow to understand where risks arise.

The model explains vulnerabilities in simple language, performs step-by-step analysis, and works with real-world scenarios. It outperforms CodeQL, traditional static analyzers, and large commercial LLMs on benchmark datasets like PrimeVul and Juliet, while being compact with only 7 billion parameters, making it faster and more cost-effective.

This marks a shift in code security from pattern matching to logical behavior analysis, with specialized smaller models gaining an edge over larger general ones.
