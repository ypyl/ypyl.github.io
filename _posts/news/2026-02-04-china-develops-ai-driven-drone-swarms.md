China is developing AI-controlled weapons and drone swarms inspired by the hunting strategies of predators like hawks and wolves. Scientists are modeling behaviors such as target tracking, coordinated group actions, pursuit, encirclement, and real-time adaptation. These drone swarms operate as a distributed intelligence system on the battlefield, with roles divided among devices for detection, distraction, and attack, rather than following centralized commands.

The approach leverages millions of years of evolutionary solutions to collective hunting, applying them to battlefield tactics. This advancement highlights how AI increasingly learns from nature's evolution rather than just human input.
