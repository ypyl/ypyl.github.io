Microsoft has announced its first AI model designed for controlling bimanual robotic systems, called **Rho-alpha**. Built on the Phi architecture, the model processes visual, textual, and tactile inputs via the VLA+ method, enabling robots to interact more precisely with physical objects. It understands natural language commands and supports continuous learning from human feedback. Currently, Rho-alpha is being tested on humanoid robots and is available through an early access program.
