The viral AI agent OpenClaw, formerly known as Clawdbot and Moltbot, has triggered a major security crisis. Originally intended as a convenient tool for computer management via messengers, it has become a significant vulnerability due to granting privileged rights to the AI agent. Confusion arose after Anthropic forced a name change, which hackers exploited by creating fake repositories containing viruses.

Meanwhile, employees are installing OpenClaw without IT approval, leading to hundreds of exposed control panels online with stolen API keys and chat histories.
