# Promt Engineering

- write, refine and optimize prompts
- perfect the interaction between humans and LLM
- continuosly monitor thos prompts
- maintain an up to date promt library

## AI

It is simulation of human intelligence processes by machines.

## Generative AI

- text responses
- images
- music
- other

## Linguistics

## Language models

## Promts

As better prompt - better result, the same as googling.

## Open AI

## Best Practices

- clear intructions
- adopt a persona
- specify the format
- avoid leading the answer
- limit the scope

## Zero shot and few shot promting

## Text embedding

# Vector Embeddings

- What are they?
    - capturing semantic meaning in a long vector. There are different models that generates such vectors and they are depends on the model.
    - 'king' - 'man' + 'woman' = 'queen' using vectors of these words

- What are they for?
    - we can compare everything to everything
    - types
        - word/text
        - graph
        - document,
        - image
        - sentence
     - use cases
        - recommendation systens
        - anomaly detection
        - transder learning
        - visualisations
        - infromation retreival
        - audio-speech processing
        - facial recognition
- How to generate?
