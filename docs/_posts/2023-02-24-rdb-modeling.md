✍ Intuitive interface makes it easy to create and edit yaml files that represent the domain of your application

🪟 You can create multiple views of your model to better understand and communicate the relationships within your software system

🔎 Our graphical interface enables you to create and edit views, layout elements and edges, zoom, scroll, and navigate through the selected view

💣 Our application highlights any inconsistencies in the model and views using error messages, ensuring your software architecture is clear and consistent

☝ The C4 model is a powerful tool for understanding and communicating the structure of your software system, and our application supports the four main types of entities in the model: actors, systems, containers, and components

👨‍🔬 Whether you're a seasoned software architect or just starting out, our application makes it easy to design and understand your software architecture
