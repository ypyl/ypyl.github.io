# Tracker Book

Reading a lot of e-books forces you to track them somehow.

It was decided to create a small application [Tracker Book](https://trackerbook.github.io/) to save and track checked/reviewed/read books.

Moreover it is written in [Avalonia UI](http://avaloniaui.net/) to check its functionality!
