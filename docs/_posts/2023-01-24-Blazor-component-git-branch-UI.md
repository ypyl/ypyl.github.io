It is surprisingly very easy to create, test and publish Blazor component library.

I decided to create a small Blazor component to represent git branch tree like `gitk` is doing, e.g.

![img](/images/gitk-branch-example.png)

And there is a project - https://github.com/ypyl/GitBranchUI.

Example of the component (published Example project) can be found [here](https://ypyl.github.io/GitBranchUI/).

Blazor is very easy to set up, use and test! It is fantastic!
