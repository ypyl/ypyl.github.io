Environment variables are only stored temporally if you are setting them using terminal:

```bash
export TEST=/home/test/
```

To save this variable for all users, need to add this command to `/etc/profile`. If you want to have this environment variable only for current user, it is needed to add this command to `~/.profile`.

Thanks.
