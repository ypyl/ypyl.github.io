There are a lot of useful notes and advises which are useful at any point of time in IT career.

# Product

## Be ahead

It is important to have broad-minded about technologies and follow the trends in IT. It will help to find a new job, learn something new, suggest a new product/technology when it will be required. On the other hand, there are too much different types of new software, libraries and frameworks, so it will be great to have knowledge, or to be familiar, with most popular ones. There is a great list of github repositories that allows to quickly identify the most popular libraries and frameworks, e.g. [https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap).

## Only writing code is not enough 

Currently, in pandemic time, you will have to start working remotely at least time to time. So your communication skills, your additional knowledge outside of programming area, your certifications, your ability to self-learning and finding the answers by yourself are starting to play more important role. I think it is important to have some additional hobbies related to programming or areas of business which are not directly connected with your current job.

## Find a guy who is smarter

There are lot of great professionals which worth to follow. Reading blogs of such guys will help to grow you as a programmer and professional. E.g. [The morning brew](https://blog.cwa.me.uk/) is a rss with a collection of great articles mostly related to .Net/Frontend development.

## Invest your time in getting knowledge

If you don't know how to spend your time, invest it in yourself. There are a lot of free courses and certifications which you can quickly check and learn something new. It doesn't really matter if you stop learning it at the beginning or at the middle of the course, or you will fail certification after the course. The most important fact is that you will have an idea about selected topic and will be familiar with it. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and the best one is [https://www.freecodecamp.org/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## Be a specialist in your current primary technology

Following new updates/fixes in your primary technology and framework is very important. It will allow you to fix the issues in products which you are working on, improve performance and stability. The adding new features to the product is only part of programmer responsibility, supporting and improving the existing functionality and general stability of the product is another.

## Be a guy who knows related technologies

It is great to know additional areas and technologies. E.g. if you know .Net, learn any frontend framework, data science topic, DevOps or any other related ares that will help you to sell yourself as a specialist.

## Your current job is not you

Don't forget that you can always leave your job or business and find something new if you want. It is very hard if you are the owner of the business, I believe, but you should always keep it in mind. At the end, our life and time that we have are limited.

## Enjoy what you are doing

If you like what you are doing, you will feel happiness and satisfaction. It is not possible always do only what you like, but, in general, you should like your job, your responsibilities and your path in the career to be a good programmer.

## Ask questions

Don't hesitate and ask questions. If you did your research and wasn't able to find answers, you have to escalate and ask questions to your team. Even if you will find out that the answer is simple, you need to ask questions and be prepared to explain them. Avoid [XY problem](https://xyproblem.info/).

## Understand your product niche

Understanding the business problems which are solved by the product you are working on allows to make less errors and ask a bunch of questions. It will help you to show your interest in what you are doing, broad your knowledge and increase your productivity.

## Find a teacher or become a teacher

If you don't know the product well or business of the product, try to find the person who wish and will help you to understand it. So you will become the expert in the topic. If you knows a lot about the product already, become a teacher! It will help you to structurize your knowledge and fill gaps in it.

## Practice in what you are learning

Knowledge without practicing costs cheap. Find possibility to use your knowledge and practicing new frameworks, libraries or approaches.

## Learn and understand other's code

Today software applications are created by many different people, so ability to understand and read other's code is crucial. Review, ask and suggest improvements in other's code if you have a possibility to do that. It will make you better programmer and also improve your communication skills.

## Automation

If you are doing the same task twice - automate it if possible! It will save your time next time, allow to 'record' the procedure to avoid potential mistakes and allow to share it with others.
