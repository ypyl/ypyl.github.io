There are a lot of useful notes and advises which are useful at any point of time in IT career.

# Product

## Be ahead

It is important to have broad-minded about technologies and follow the trends in IT. It will help to find a new job, learn something new, suggest a new product/technology when it will be required. On the other hand, there are too much different types of new software, libraries and frameworks, so it will be great to have knowledge, or to be familiar, with most popular ones. There is a great list of github repositories that allows to quickly identify the most popular libraries and frameworks, e.g. [https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap).

## Only writing code is not enough 

Currently, in pandemic time, you will have to start working remotely at least time to time. So your communication skills, your additional knowledge outside of programming area, your certifications, your ability to self-learning and finding the answers by yourself are starting to play more important role. I think it is important to have some additional hobbies related to programming or areas of business which are not directly connected with your current job.

## Find a guy who is smarter

There are lot of great professionals which worth to follow. Reading blogs of such guys will help to grow you as a programmer and professional. E.g. [The morning brew](https://blog.cwa.me.uk/) is a rss with a collection of great articles mostly related to .Net/Frontend development.

## Invest your time in getting knowledge

If you don't know how to spend your time, invest it in yourself. There are a lot of free courses and certifications which you can quickly check and learn something new. It doesn't really matter if you stop learning it at the beginning or at the middle of the course, or you will fail certification after the course. The most important fact is that you will have an idea about selected topic and will be familiar with it. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and the best one is [https://www.freecodecamp.org/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## Be a specialist in your current primary technology

Following new updates/fixes in your primary technology and framework is very important. It will allow you to fix the issues in products which you are working on, improve performance and stability. The adding new features to the product is only part of programmer responsibility, supporting and improving the existing functionality and general stability of the product is another.

## Be a guy who knows related technologies

It is great to know additional areas and technologies. E.g. if you know .Net, learn any frontend framework, data science topic, DevOps or any other related ares that will help you to sell yourself as a specialist.

## Your current job is not you

Don't forget that you can always leave your job or business and find something new if you want. It is very hard if you are the owner of the business, I believe, but you should always keep it in mind. At the end, our life and time that we have are limited.

## Enjoy what you are doing

If you like what you are doing, you will feel happiness and satisfaction. It is not possible always do only what you like, but, in general, you should like your job, your responsibilities and your path in the career to be a good programmer.
