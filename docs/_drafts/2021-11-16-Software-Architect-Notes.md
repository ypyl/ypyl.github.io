# Software Architecture

## What is software architecture

Software architecture is the foundation for the software system.

It consists of different aspects:

- structures and elements of a system
- relationships between system's elements or components
- abstractions of a system

Benefits to having clean and explicit architecture:

- enabling and inhibiting quality attributes
- predicting system quality
- easing communication between all members/consumers of a system (stakeholders, owners, developers, and so on)
- allowing to more easily make changes
- providing a reusable model for other products
- imposing implementation constraints
- allowing to do cost and effort estimation
- simplifying training for new developers

Software architect main responsibilities are:

- technical decisions
- architecture of a system
- documentation
- following and improving software architecture approaches and principles within the organization

## Software architects in an organization

Software architect means different in different companies. Some companies already have software development methodologies and it is required to follow them. So each software architect should be familiar with them. If it is allowed to select the software development methodology, software architect should be able to explain his choice.

Software architect has the following responsibilities within an organization:

- tasks estimation
- projects planning
- controlling and monitoring
- communication with stakeholders and management
- risk management
- coordination of builds, development, and production environments
- supporting and introducing product lines (reusable architecture components)
- business domain understanding
- identifying and clarifying requirements to a software system

## Domain

Understanding the domain is a key part of being software architect. It is required to have general business knowledge and a good understanding of the organization's business. So it will be possible to design software architecture that solves business problems effectively.

DDD is a proven approach to modeling the domain:

- creating ubiquitous language to simplify and improve communication between everyone
- identify entities, value objects, aggregates, and root entities
- separating domain into subdomains and creating bounded contexts

Moreover, proper requirements engineering is an important part of creating a software architecture. Usually, it is not easy to get and elicit all requirements from stakeholders, but knowing requirements is crucial to designing a good solution.

## Quality attributes

The software must match the designed quality attributes, so software architect should properly identify and specify them so they can be tested and measured.

There are two main types of quality attributes: functional and non-functional.

Some important non-functional attributes:

- maintainability
- usability
- availability
- portability
- interoperability
- testability
- security
- performance
