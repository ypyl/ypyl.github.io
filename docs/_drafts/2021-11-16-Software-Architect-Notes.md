# Software Architecture

## What is software architecture

Software architecture is the foundation for the software system.

It consists of different aspects:

- structures and elements of a system
- relationships between system's elements or components
- abstractions of a system

Benefits to having clean and explicit architecture:

- enabling and inhibiting quality attributes
- predicting system quality
- easing communication between all members/consumers of a system (stakeholders, owners, developers, and so on)
- allowing to more easily make changes
- providing a reusable model for other products
- imposing implementation constraints
- allowing to do cost and effort estimation
- simplifying training for new developers

Software architect main responsibilities are:

- technical decisions
- architecture of a system
- documentation
- following and improving software architecture approaches and principles within the organization

## Software architects in an organization

Software architect means different in different companies. Some companies already have software development methodologies and it is required to follow them. So each software architect should be familiar with them. If it is allowed to select the software development methodology, software architect should be able to explain his choice.

Software architect has the following responsibilities within an organization:

- tasks estimation
- projects planning
- controlling and monitoring
- communication with stakeholders and management
- risk management
- coordination of builds, development, and production environments
- supporting and introducing product lines (reusable architecture components)
- business domain understanding
- identifying and clarifying requirements to a software system
