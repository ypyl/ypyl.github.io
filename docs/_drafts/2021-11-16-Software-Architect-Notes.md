# Software Architecture

Software architecture is the foundation for the software system.

It consists from different aspects:

- structures and elements of a system
- relationships between system's elements or components
- abstractions of a system

Benefits to have clean and explicit architecture:

- enabling and inhibiting quality attributes
- predicting system quality
- easing communication between all members/consumers of a system (stakeholders, owners, developers and so on)
- allowing to more easily make changes
- providing a reusable model for other products
- imposing implementaion constraints
- allowing to do cost and effort estimation
- simplifying training for new developers

Software architect main responsobilities are:

- technical decisions
- architecture of a system
- documentation
- following and improving software architecture approaches and principles withing the organization
