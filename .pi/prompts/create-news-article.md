Anthropic has published a new version of the **Claude Constitution**—a core document that defines the AI's values and decision-making principles. This update shifts from a simple list of rules to a logical framework for reasoning.

Key changes include:
- A clear **priority hierarchy**: Safety > Ethicality > Anthropic's Policies > Helpfulness.
- **Hard constraints** on high-risk topics (e.g., biological weapons development).
- A new section reflecting on Claude's **nature and potential consciousness**.
- The constitution is designed **for the model itself** to use as an internal guide.

The document is released under **CC0 (public domain)**, free for anyone to use or adapt.
